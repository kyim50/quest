# APP DESCRIPTION
- Quests is a map-based app designed to foster local connections through spontaneous daily task requests. It encourages face-to-face interactions, particularly helping users with social anxiety, by providing face to face interaction based on everyday tasks to promote networking. The app prioritizes privacy and safety, offering private accounts, activity logs, and location-sharing only during active tasks. Quests aims to make connecting/networking with new people more approachable and engaging.
- It's designed in a sense to allow user's to interact in a local environment. You create a request and it sends a signal to other users on the app in which they can accept or decline the request. After accepting a request, user's will see a route displayed on the map for the receiver to lead them to the request's sender.

# TODO

## UI
- Restyle old page modals.
- Make quest modal.
- Add fullscreen mode to maps
- Create modal for search and filter.
- style the image preview which appears after you take a picture 
- Add light/dark mode variants and add to settings.

 Fix page modal for mobile.

 Create settings menu.

## Front-End Logic

- Fix the map where when you go in fullscreen and then exit it, the map ends up displaced and the styling changes. 
- Also make it so that when you scroll down on smaller screen the minimzed map button also minimizes the marker and it dosent make you go on the map box website but rather goes straight to the full screen map.

## Back-End
- migrate the database to postgres and microsoft azure
- make it so the hosting is on azure services
